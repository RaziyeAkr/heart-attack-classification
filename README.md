This notebook is about comparing the performance of several **lassification algorithms**.<br>
<br>
**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**<br>
In this file, there are several famous algorithms in the field of classification for data from https://www.kaggle.com/ <br>
I found out that there are studies about heart attack.<br>
The accuracy of each algorithm has been checked in four ways, which can be named as follows:
**accuracy_score, f1-csore, log_loss, jacard**
I hope this notebook was useful for you.
